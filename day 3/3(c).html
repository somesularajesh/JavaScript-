    <p>There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories<br>: primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), and special data types. <br>String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types.<br> Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types.<br> Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.</p>
